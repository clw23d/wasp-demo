// times i want dialogue to appear:
	// when you first start the game:
		// wasp: "ugh, its time to go to work"
		// wasp: "i better grab my hat first"
				// code to swap sprite when you overlap the hat
					// "EQUIPED HAT"
					// wasp: "w√ß"
	// when you leave the room (when x is far enough to the right)
		// "i'll fly over to the house and ring the doorbell"
	// when you press the doorbell
			// woman: "hello, is this the exterminator?"
			// wasp: "yep thats me"
			// woman: "finally, you're here!"
			// woman "ive been waiting for you to get rid of these..."
			// "... nasty cockroaches!" // a shake effect would be great
			// wasp: "well thats what i'm here for, maam"
			// wasp: ("and just in time to lay my eggs...")
			// woman: "what was that?"
			// wasp: "nothing, maam"
			// woman: "well, come on in, dear"
	// when you enter the house
		// Find the cockroach oothecae (egg cases) and lay your eggs in them to complete the extermination
		// (When the ensign wasp babies hatch, they will eat all the unhatched cockroach eggs.)
		// (Thats the circle of life!)
	// when enough eggs are collected (or when the timer is up?)
		// wasp: "that should be all of them."
	// when you leave the house (is the woman standing by the door? idk)
		// wasp: "well maam, you should see the number of cockroaches decrease soon."
		// woman: "thank you dear, you've been such a great help!"
		// "maybe next time you can help me with those dreadfull wasps in my backyard!"
		// music cuts out or something
		// "oh i just hate wasps, they're so scary, and they just sting for no reason!"
		// "there's not one good thing about them!"
		// wasp: "um. maybe they're just trying to protect their hive, maam."
		// "and most kinds of wasps aren't even capable of stinging. 
		// "stingers are modified ovipositors, y'see, and parisitiod wasps use--"
		// woman: "if didn't know any better, i'd say you were a wasp."
		// "maybe i should go grab my bug spray and find out." // bold or something
		// "ha ha!"
		// wasp: "..."
		// "have a good day maam."
	// when you get home and go to bed
		// "i helped her out with her pest problem, but she.."
		// "i just don't get it."
		// "i hope my children make it out of that house alive."

		// ok so im gonna try the stages thing
		// no first i need dialogue to progress
